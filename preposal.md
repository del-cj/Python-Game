# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to make a sort of adventure fighting game inspired by the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". However, instead of rock, paper, scissors, the options are melee, mage, and range. Similar to how rock beats scissors and so on, there would be a "combat triangle" where melee beats range, range beats mage, and mage beats melee.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I might work with Aditi Rao

## Do you have any questions of your own?

None yet
