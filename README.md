# Python-Game
For the final project in CIS 1051, my partner, Aditi Rao, and I decided to make a game together. 

For a brief description of the game and the initial vision for the project, please refer proposal.md

I came up with the core concept of having a combat/adventure game with 3 conmbat styles. 
Together, through creative colaboration, we created the concept that is described in the proposal.
We created a list of mechanics we wanted to have in our game and divided the tasks. 
Aditi created the initial diceroll.py file and I created the other files, including the maingame.py file that runs the game.
Due to time constraints and the current pandemic, we were only able to produce a text based version of our game.

I hope to return to this project in the future and develop a version with visuals and animation like envisioned in the proposal.
